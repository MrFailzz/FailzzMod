# Vanilla++ V1

Thanks to SirPlease and the many people who have worked on the [Competitive Rework](https://github.com/SirPlease/L4D2-Competitive-Rework), which I've used as an inspiration and base for this project.
Special thanks to the people who helped testing this project out.


View the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/MrFailzz/FailzzMod/wiki) to see a list of all changes done. Still a work in progress.
